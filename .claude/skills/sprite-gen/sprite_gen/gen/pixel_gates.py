"""Gates G2..G6 and G8 of `pixel-draw`, on the pixels of a grid that passed G1 (it parsed whole).

G3, G4, G5 and G8 ask the judgment sprite-gen already makes of the same question elsewhere — one
function each, called here, never a copy (docs/pixel-draw.md "Gates"):

- G2 palette: the opaque colours used (`colors_used`, also `palette.json`'s) are at most the rule's
  limit; a fixed palette allows only its own colours.
- G3 alpha: whether a frame's background is really transparent is `gen.chroma.alpha_verdict`, the
  judgment `gen` reads a generated raw by — `real-alpha` at least 5 % of the pixels and half the
  one-pixel border alpha 0, `no-alpha` none. A sprite or icon frame is `real-alpha` with something
  drawn and its four corners clear; a tile frame is `no-alpha`.
- G4 tile seam (warning): `background.tile.inspect_tile`, the join `background-tile` measures —
  the wrap edge against the tile's own neighbours — asked of each tile frame along x and along y.
  An axis it says needs review warns: a local measure, never proof that a tile repeats cleanly, so
  look at `tiled-3x3.png`.
- G5 stray pixels (warning): the lone pixels of a sprite or icon, `frames.extract.isolated_dots` —
  opaque, with no opaque pixel among their eight neighbours, the dots the YCbCr matte cleanup
  erases. A pixel that touches another only at a corner, as each pixel of a diagonal stroke does,
  is joined to it.
- G6 frames: every frame stands on the same bottom row, heights differ by at most one pixel and
  no two frames are the same. A sprite's or icon's rows and heights are measured inside its safe
  area: a staff raised or a spark into the margin in one frame is not a taller figure (G8 notes
  the margin). A walk cycle (contact, passing, contact, passing) also warns when
  its two contact frames differ by less than 40% of the mean contact↔passing difference: the legs
  barely change sides.
- G6 of one motion — the frames, in their order, are one motion (`--motion`; a walk cycle is one
  too). This is the rule's one place; docs/pixel-draw.md points here. A motion changes the
  silhouette: an arm goes over the head, a blade swings past it, a pose is held for a beat. So:
  * one ground still fails: every frame stands on the same bottom row (inside the safe area, as
    above);
  * a height that differs from the first frame's by more than the pixel G6 allows is asked of the
    judgment the image path makes of the same question — did the body change size, or only its
    pose? — `video.gait_fallback.size_change`, on `body_size` (height, mass, breadth) of each frame
    against the first, inside the safe area. A pose moves the three apart (an arm over the head adds
    height, not mass); a body drawn larger or smaller moves them together. When all three move one
    way by more than that pixel of the first frame's height, it warns (the body changes size — a
    redraw candidate); otherwise it is an info line (the height changes with the pose);
  * frames drawn the same are a hold, an info line.
  Nothing but the ground fails a motion.
- G8 safe area, on a sprite or icon: the engine's safe area (`safe_area`, the margin `prepare`
  keeps around every cell), a target for the body's average size and not a wall. G8 never fails.
  Its judgment is the one the image path makes when it snaps a sprite to pixels,
  `frames.extract.safe_area_fit`, called on each frame's opaque box: past the physical cap (the
  canvas's width, its height less the margin under the floor row) warns, a reroll candidate; past
  the safe area but within the cap is an info line; nothing fails. G8 also warns when a sprite's
  body box — the rows and columns holding at least a quarter as many opaque pixels as the fullest
  one, so a thin tip drops out of it — does not end on the floor row, the safe area's own bottom
  row, where `prepare`'s fit grounds a frame. Below 11 px the margin is 0: the safe area and the
  cap are the canvas.

A failed gate fails the candidate; a warning is reported and passes; an info line is reported and
asks for nothing.
