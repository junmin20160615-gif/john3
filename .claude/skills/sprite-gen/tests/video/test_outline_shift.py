"""The outline read rank by rank (docs/loop-repair.md section 4): `rife.outline_shift` reads a made frame's
coverage edge against its two neighbours' at the same rank, and the fault `outline` of the frames the jump
repair and the cycle alignment make needs it over the line as well as `outline_loss`. A line outlined in a
mid tone, either side of the dark line (70/255), and drawn a little lighter by the flow is kept; a line gone
to the fill is lost, whatever tone the art outlines in. It is read only where both neighbours are outlined
(`rife.outlined`): art painted without a line is judged on the dark line alone, as the versioned measures,
which carry `rife.smear` alone, judge every frame.

The fixtures are synthetic: the walker of tests/video/test_rife.py twice the size, outlined in bands of two
browns either side of 70/255 (luma 57 and 77), the frame between drawn with its line lighter or its legs'
line turned to fill; and the same walker painted without a line, the frame between with a boot washed
lighter. The one real-RIFE case runs where RIFE is installed."""
