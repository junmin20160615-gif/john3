"""The flow reading (docs/loop-repair.md section 2, "The flow reading"): a frame is taken when it lies off
the path its neighbours draw — against the way a part is going, or a sudden change of its speed — not
when its step is large. An ordinary walk, whose legs swing fast and plant slow, has no frame taken; a
frame whose tail is flung against its sway is the one frame taken; a tail that snaps back at a wrap
that does not close has the frames at the wrap taken; and which way the body faces does not matter.
The repair (`repair.repair_jumps`) takes those frames out and makes them again between the frames
either side, each at its own time: the loop keeps its length, and a loop on twos its hold.

The loops are drawn here: a body, two legs swinging quick through the swing and slow through the
stance, an arm, and a tail behind that sways once a cycle."""
